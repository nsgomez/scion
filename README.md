# Scion Â· a Maxis framework implementation

**Scion** is an implementation of the GZCOM/RZCOM framework used by SimCity 4 and The Sims 2. Its main goal is to
achieve functional parity with the framework used in SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition. As a stretch goal, it also tries,
where possible, to produce identical machine code, such that the assembly matches when compiled for Windows with
the right toolset and options.

After the framework is finished, I'd like to use Scion to reverse-engineer SimCity 4 itself in the same vein as
other open-source game projects (e.g. OpenTTD, OpenRCT2).

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by EA Games.

## Building

Scion currently only targets Windows. It should be buildable with any C++03-compliant compiler, but currently there
are only project files for Visual Studio .NET 2003. That appears to be the toolset used for building SimCity 4
Deluxe.

This project also uses [STLport](http://www.stlport.org/) instead of the compiler-provided STL. To build STLport,
open the Visual Studio command line and run:

```
cd src\stlport\src
nmake -f vc7.mak
nmake -f vc7.mak install
```

Once STLport is built, the framework solution can be built too.

The LGPL allows you to dynamically link this project with proprietary software like the Maxis games that use this
framework; in other words, you can use it to write framework hooks for those non-free games. But if you make changes to
Scion itself, those changes must be shared under the LGPLv2.1 license.
